# Anchored Intrapage Links

**1.** Text in Brackets  
**2.** Link in parantheses **IMPORTANT:** this is part of a url and therefore
* begin with hashtag  
* url text must be adjacent to hashtag  
* no spaces - replace with dash
* no dots/decimals/periods/full stops
* all characters must be lowercase (it's ok for element to have uppercase letters)  
* target does not have to be single hashtag heading

**3.** Create target but **space must be between hashtag and text**  
**Reminder:** For lists: two spaces after each item to break to next line
