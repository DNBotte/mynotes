# MACHINE LEARNING
## Repo

In an effort to transform my Machine Learning knowledge from swiss cheese into a Bernini scultpure, I am creating a centralized repo on Github of everything I've [re]learned and created.  
This repo will include experimental projects as well as notes from refresher courses that encompass and consolidate my background in econometrics, game theory, and object oriented programming with Python.
