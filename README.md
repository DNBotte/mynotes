This is where I store all of my notes.

I've decided to do so on GitHub because:
* It's digital (no cumbersome notebooks)
* No need to log into any cloud accounts
* Easy to read and navigate
* Customization (md, html, python shells, etc.)
* I can eventually integrate some things into my website
* Who knows, maybe someone would be interested in seeing them

Anyone who values what they see here is welcome to fork this repo and even contribute to it.
