Launch a github repository with your own handmade set of instructions in markdown!

1. Create a table.
   Columns (which are actually called fields in the world of pivot tables) should be labeled up top.
   Rows can also be labeled but this is not necessary

2. Highlite table

3. Go to the "insert" tab

4. Click "Pivot Table" (far left)
   *Pivot Charts located in center, to the left of the regular chart options

5. Click "OK" if pivot table should be in a new sheet, otherwhise click "Existing Worksheet" first

6. Drag row data from top list down to the Rows block in the lower left corner of the right tab
Note: if the sidebar does not load, right click in the pivot table area and choose "view field list"

7. Repeat for columns but place in values quadrant


Field Areas:

Row Labels - appear to the left of table

Values - appear in fields

Column Labels - appear on top of table

	Example:

Place Product as Row Labels for a list of products

Use Price as Values to list corresponding revenue

Place Months as Column Lables to spread out each product's revenue by month

Labels are ordered by hiearchy

	Example:

Place Store in Row Labels above Product to create two tables, one for each store, or below Product to split each product between stores. This works similarly with Column Labels

Report Filters

Can be found by right clicking or using the drop down arrows

Filter out things by inequalities, top 10, etc.

Place Category in Report Filter then select items from drop down that appears above table
