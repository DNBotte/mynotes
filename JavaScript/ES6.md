Below are some quick reminders for ES6:

const vs. let vs. var

More flexibility and security with scope and [re]assignment

const - assingment remains constant
let - like var but scoped by block
var - scope depends on function

template literals

kinda like place holders in python
```javascript
const myString = 'text';

console.log(`Place all the ${myString} in between back tics, with the variable in between curly brackets preceded by a dollar sign`);
```
